# Issues Related to *ChemDraw*-*Office* Integration on *Mac*

Copy from ChemDraw to Office and copy back is fine on Mac, with Office version 2011 and ChemDraw version 17.1.
The image quality on Mac is allright.

When copy the picture from ChemDraw to Office in Windows, it works fine. Double clicking the picture in the office will link to ChemDraw. Then open the document on Mac, double clicking function doesn't work. (If originally create the document on Mac, there isn't any link with the picture.) The image quality is good on Mac the same with Windows. (But for the trail version on Windows, copy picture to Office will cause the software break down.)
