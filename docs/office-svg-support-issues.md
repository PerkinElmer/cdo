# Issues Related to *Office* SVG Support

Create an SVG image by ChemDraw and insert it into word in Windows is fine. And when open the file by Office on Mac it is also fine. Image quality is good because it is vector picture.

But on Mac, due to the version is old, the SVG file cannont be inserted in to the document. On the old version Office on Windows, the SVG file also cannot be inserted into the word document.
