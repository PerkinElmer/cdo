# Issues Related to Cross-Platform Support of *Office* Document Embedded *ChemDraw* Images

The word file which authored on Mac appear fine on Windows.

However, when copy from office which authored in Mac to ChemDraw on Windows the picture showed in the ChemDraw is just like PDF, cannot be modified like normal. Besides, the image quality is also not as good as vector image in the ChemDraw.

And when copy from ChamDraw(Mac) to Web version Office, the picture quality is bad and cannot be copied back to ChemDraw even in a PDF model. The image cannon display in ChemDraw.
